# Example

In this example, we have the following files:

- `config.json` The configuration file for the `@mygql/codegen` command.
- `countries.json` A GraphQL introspection JSON file grabbed from [https://countries.trevorblades.com](https://countries.trevorblades.com/) for demonstration.
- `countries.ts` A file generated by the `@mygql/codegen` command.
- `client.ts` An example file that uses the generated TypeScript file to create a GraphQL client.

Pease check [config.json](./config.json) and [client.ts](./client.ts) for details.
